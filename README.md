# Blog

This is an example of blog developed in Angular. It has no db and it has been used `angular-in-memory-web-api` in order to keep temporary data. If you are an anonymous user you can only read the posts added. You can login as author with either one of following accounts:

| Username | Password |
| -------- | -------- |
| admin    | admin    |
| user     | user     |

There is no difference between them in terms of privileges. If you are an author you can add and edit posts. As soon as you login you will be redirected to the list of the posts. It is the same when you click on logout: you will be redirected to the same page.
